                <h2 class="caption">On our collaboration</h2>
                <p>
                    You and I come together from different paths, cultures, and perspectives. We share a collective concern for evolving instabilities in our shared socio-ecological system -- for our collective probing of nebulous boundaries between local attractors of coexistence and coextinction. We acknowledge the divisive challenges of uncertainty brought by instability in our communities. We also acknowledge our emotional and cultural draws to turn our attention inward and away from other species, cultures, communities, and perspectives when uncertainty overwhelms us. Together we recognize that our inward-turning erodes our capacity to respond to systemic instabilities with informed, mutualistic, stabilizing acts. We choose instead to collaborate, to nurture ecocultural seeds of outward-turning, relational complicity in our coexistence, to nourish the restorative feedbacks which emerge as resilience in our shared socio-ecological system. Honoring where we find ourselves today, we choose to walk together in empathy and collaboration, reawakening a path of mutualism toward a more stable coexistence tomorrow.
                </p>
                <h2 class="caption">Research as a step</h2>
                <p>
                    Shared stability begins with observation. Bear cubs watch their mamas closely to learn the art of how to eat what and when, with locally tuned wisdom echoing across diverse communities and climates. The work of a researcher is to respectfully foster a collective understanding of the experiences and relationships of other beings, to empower a mutualistic coexistence. The path of understanding cannot be shared by entering a new community with a cacophony of self righteous praise. Instead it calls for respectful listening, self-awareness of our limited perspectives, and open-mindedness to consider a realm of possible experiences and relationships which may differ from our own. Perhaps this means sitting by a stream to allow an aquatic community to enlighten us to its local ecological wisdom. This may mean holding space for misunderstanding -- that natural perturbation of living ideas which thrives in diverse communities -- to expand the thought horizons of our feedbacks. This may look like listening intentionally to the stories of our elders, to expand the time horizons of our feedbacks. Stability in dynamic systems requires feedbacks, and all feedbacks require listening.

                </p>
                <h2 class="caption">Data management as a step</h2>
                <p>
                    Long-term stability is nourished by long-term system memory. Elder spruce trees epigenetically pass down knowledge of historic conditions to their seedlings, so that they may be more prepared when extreme moisture or temperature events come to visit again. The work of a data manager is to nurture our collective memory. The hard earned observations of researchers cannot inform our relational complicity once they have been washed downstream. At the same time, we cannot contain the entirety of the river of knowledge. Empowering data management selectively recirculates that which can inform mutualistic, stabilizing acts into the future, in ways that are accessible, parsable, interpretable and relevant. We can remember that the scribe need not necessarily speak the language to preserve its message. Data should represent a diversity of sources and perspectives, and through preservation be made available to a diversity of listeners and storytellers. Stability in adaptive systems requires memory, and memory is enhanced by empowering data management.
                </p>
                <h2 class="caption">Education as a step</h2>
                <p>
                    Knowledge is not meant to be stored. The stories that find us through our observations and collective memory come with the responsibility to be shared. Willow communities maintain diverse and distributed genomes across isolated riparian areas through widespread dispersal of pollen. The work of the educator is to share empowering stories as seeds, to nurture diverse and reciprocal identity exploration in others. Distributed systems are more resilient to local perturbation. Educating for resilience means letting go of centralized knowledge control, to empower collaborative engagement with and co-management, of a dynamic knowledge commons. An education which celebrates diverse minds and values plants seeds of diverse interpretations of knowledge to come, supporting diverse and distributed feedbacks in our complex socio-ecological web. Stability in complex systems requires diversity, and shared knowledge is diversified through empowering education.
